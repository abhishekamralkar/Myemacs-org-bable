#+tile: My Emacs Config

This is my Emacs config which I use almost every day and night. In this config I am using a literate programming and org-babel to 
organize my Emacs configuration.

* To use this config

You need to have Emacs 27+ installed on your machine and jusst clone this repo into your `~/.emacs.d`.
